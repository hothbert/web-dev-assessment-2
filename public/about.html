            <h6>Why take a course with the Open University?</h6>
            <p>My school did not offer Advanced Higher Computing Science as a subject so I decided to do this course instead so that I could continue my learning.</p>
            <h4>Development Process</h4>
            <p>The website development process started by making a framework/general layout, to be kept consistent across the web pages (although it was simplified for the chat page). Bootstrap and styles were added to improve the appearence of pages. Content was then added to both the home and about pages, as well as some additional features such as a card, accordion and a carousel of images. Next, all HTML and CSS code was validated to check for errors. Lastly, the chat application was created. Git commits were made throughout the proccess.</p>
